          <p>
            This project began during my internship, where I was tasked with improving the 
            stability of reduced time series representations used in financial data analysis. 
            I noticed that traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly PCA, 
            caused abrupt jumps in the transformed data over time—especially when applied to 
            evolving, non-stationary financial signals. This inconsistency, 
            clearly visible in the graph below, highlighted a critical issue: PCA’s assumptions
            often fail in time-dependent environments. Motivated to find a solution, Robust 
            Rolling PCA (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4400158" target="_blank">R2-PCA</a>) is a method designed to handle temporal shifts while 
            preserving interpretability and minimizing instability in 
            lower-dimensional projections.</p>

            <div class="video-wrapper">
                <img class="video" src="../assets/images/graphs/standard_pca_with_jumps_and_legend.png" alt="Model Visualization" style="width:1000px;">
            </div>

          <p>At the core of R2-PCA is the idea that temporal consistency matters when applying 
            PCA recursively to time series data. A key issue with standard PCA in this context
             is eigenvector sign flipping, where the direction of principal components can 
             arbitrarily reverse between time steps—leading to sharp, misleading jumps in 
             projected data. R2-PCA solves this by enforcing directional consistency across 
             time. It does so by calculating the cosine similarity between current and 
             previous eigenvectors—since PCA produces unit vectors, this similarity is 
             just a dot product. If a similarity score is negative (indicating a sign flip), 
             the eigenvector is multiplied by −1 to align it with its prior orientation. 
             Additionally, R2-PCA addresses the issue of changing principal component order 
             over time, which arises when market forces shift the features that contribute 
             most to variance. To resolve this, R2-PCA reorders the principal components at 
             each time step based on the highest absolute cosine similarity to the previous 
             period’s components. This ensures that components are matched consistently over 
             time, both in direction and importance, allowing for stable and interpretable
              projections in dynamic financial environments.</p>

          <p>In the animation above, we can see the eigenvector flipping effect for the standard PCA model. 
            Notice the immediate effect on when the new data is projected on the flipped eigenvectors. 
            This illustrates the importance of R2-PCA on reducing time series data; 
            without it the dataset is nearly unusable as data appears to be randomly multiplied by -1. 
            A further comparison of R2-PCA to another industry model can be found in the Data Visualization section.

          <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an important methodology to reduce
          and extract meaningful signals from large data-sets. 
          Financial markets introduce time and non stationarity aspects, 
          where applying standard PCA methods may not give stable results. 
          We propose robust rolling PCA (R2-PCA) that accommodates the additional 
          aspects and mitigates commonly found obstacles including eigenvector sign flipping,
          and managing multiple dimensions of the data-set. This makes R2-PCA an ideal 
          candidate for learning-based models. We demonstrate the methodology on mutual 
          fund data-sets and illustrate its advantages in terms of applicability, 
          and explainability.</p> -->

          The <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4729393" target="_blank">R2K-Means</a> research project comes from a need to update cluster information in as rolling 
          time series. At each step/point in time, a modified version of the K-Means algorithm 
          is run to produce stable, updateable clusters in evolving datasets such as financial 
          markets. Unlike standard K-Means, which suffers from random initialization sensitivity 
          and inconsistent cluster labeling, R2K-Means carries forward centroid positions 
          from previous time periods, enabling smooth updates when new data arrives. 
          This approach reduces instability, preserves meaningful cluster relationships, 
          and can naturally form non-linear decision boundaries without kernel methods—making 
          it especially useful for dynamically modeling and tracking asset behaviors over time.

          <p>The animation above shows naïve K-Means clustering applied to a financial time series dataset, 
            highlighting how random initialization can 
            dramatically distort results and make them unreliable. The colored dots represent 
            centroids calculated in a rolling window, which R2K-Means uses to form non-linear 
            decision boundaries. While a single K-Means run at a given time produces only linear 
            boundaries, aggregating rolling windows of K-Means clusters and projecting them to the 
            present allows R2K-Means to capture meaningful non-linear patterns.</p>

          <p>The animation above shows how R2K-Means performs on a time series, offering much greater 
            stability 
            than the naïve implementation. As the rolling window fills, it produces non-linear decision 
            boundaries—an essential feature for datasets with irregular shapes and outliers, 
            which are common in financial markets.</p>

          I co-developed Robust Rolling Transformer Text Classification (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4818564" target="_blank">R2-T2C</a>), 
          a framework for objectively analyzing large, multi-sourced document corpora over time. 
          R2-T2C extracts and embeds sections of each document in a rolling window, 
          applies GPT-enhanced category generation, and uses similarity measures like cosine 
          similarity to classify documents into user-defined categories. The framework produces 
          rich graphs and visualizations—including t-SNE and UMAP projections—that make 
          high-dimensional embedding data intuitive to explore. This approach supports absolute, 
          relative, related, and trend-based assessments, making it especially valuable for evolving 
          and inconsistent reporting landscapes such as climate finance disclosures. 
          By combining transformer models, rolling embeddings, clustering, and clear visuals, 
          R2-T2C delivers a scalable, unbiased way to understand how documents change, 
          compare against guidelines, and align with peers.

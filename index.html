        <div class="main-box-content">

          <p>I’m Ryan Holmes, a machine learning researcher with a track record of developing innovative AI solutions for complex, 
            high-dimensional, and time-sensitive data. My expertise spans the full ML pipeline—data 
            preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment—with a 
            strong focus on interpretable, updateable, and production-ready systems.</p>

          <p>
            Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Ask2.ai, where I design algorithms 
            and frameworks that extend classical methods like PCA, K-Means, and clustering into robust, 
            time-aware systems capable of adapting to streaming data without sacrificing stability. 
            My work includes building multi-modal LLM/RAG pipelines, advanced document classification 
            frameworks, and custom visualization tools that transform high-dimensional embeddings into 
            actionable insights using t-SNE, UMAP, and interactive Python animations. 
            I lead cross-functional research projects that blend rigorous statistical modeling with 
            large-scale AI architectures, always prioritizing explainability, scalability, and
             measurable impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            I excel at transforming messy, real-world datasets into reliable models that deliver meaningful 
            results—combining technical rigor with clear, intuitive outputs. 
            I believe data visualization is one of the most important bridges 
            between human understanding and machine intelligence, making complex 
            models transparent, explainable, and ultimately more trustworthy. 
            The animation below is one example of how I use visualization to reveal 
            model behavior and uncover patterns that raw metrics alone often miss.

            <p>
            I earned my Master of Science in Financial Engineering from Columbia University, 
            where I developed a strong foundation in advanced quantitative methods, 
            machine learning, and computational finance. The program challenged me to 
            integrate rigorous mathematical modeling with real-world financial applications. 
            Through courses such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Monte Carlo Methods, 
            and Algorithmic Trading, I gained hands-on experience designing and implementing
            models that operate under uncertainty and time dynamics. 
            My technical skill set was further refined through Programming for 
            Financial Engineering (C++) and Optimization, equipping me to build robust, 
            high-performance systems in both research and production settings.<br><br>

            Prior to Columbia, I completed my undergraduate studies at Butler University, 
            earning a Bachelor of Science in Finance with minors in Mathematics, 
            Actuarial Science, and Art + Design. This multidisciplinary background gave me a 
            well-rounded perspective on both the quantitative and creative aspects of 
            problem-solving. I pursued advanced coursework in Real Analysis, 
            Financial Mathematics, Econometrics, and Financial Derivatives, 
            laying a solid analytical and theoretical foundation.

            <p>Outside of my research, I enjoy exploring a variety of creative and strategic pursuits. 
              I work in both acrylic and oil painting, and I’m an avid player of strategy and tabletop 
              games such as Warhammer and Magic: The Gathering. I also have a passion for history,
               often diving into documentaries that bring the past to life, 
               and I find joy in hands-on creative outlets like building with LEGO. 
               These hobbies give me a balance between analytical thinking and artistic expression, 
               fueling both my problem-solving and creativity.
